#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Stephanie and Anwar paired together. It took about 60 minutes (plus 30 trying to understand nodemon)**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on initializing our project using NPM to create and populate a package.json file
  2. Next, we instantiated and required express so we could use its functionality
  3. Third, we included all of the static resources as an argument to app.use(), defining which directory we will serve our files from
  4. Next, we wrote a new route to handle a request and send the new.html file back to the user, and to handle 404 errors.
  5. Then, we added a console message regarding the PORT.
  6. We installed nodemon (discovering it works best when installed globally.) It took a while to understand what nodemon does.
